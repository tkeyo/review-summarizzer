# Context
- I want to build an MVP to validate value of a review summarizer for our business
- It will receive a number user reviews, extract the most imporant information from the reviews and generate a summary of the reviews

# Preferred tech stack
- Use FastAPI as webserver
- Database is not needed
- Frontend will not be a part of the MVP

# Instructions
- always ask clarifying questions if there's anything unclear
